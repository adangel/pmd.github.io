### New and noteworthy

#### SARIF Format

PMD now supports the [Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=sarif)
as an additional report format. Just use the [command line parameter](pmd_userdocs_cli_reference.html#format) `-format sarif` to select it.
SARIF is an OASIS standard format for static analysis tools.
PMD creates SARIF JSON files in [SARIF version 2.1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html).
An example report can be found in the documentation in [Report formats for PMD](pmd_userdocs_report_formats.html#sarif).

#### CPD

*   The C++ module now supports the new option [`--ignore-literal-sequences`](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#-ignore-literal-sequences),
    which can be used to avoid detection of some uninteresting clones. This options has been
    introduced with PMD 6.30.0 for C# and is now available for C++ as well. See [#2963](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/2963).

#### New Rules

*   The new Apex rule [`OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.31.0/pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#overridebothequalsandhashcode) brings the well known Java rule
    to Apex. In Apex the same principle applies: `equals` and `hashCode` should always be overridden
    together to ensure collection classes such as Maps and Sets work as expected.

*   The new Visualforce rule [`VfHtmlStyleTagXss`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.31.0/pmd_rules_vf_security.html#vfhtmlstyletagxss) checks for potential XSS problems
    when using `<style>` tags on Visualforce pages.

#### Deprecated rules

*   java-performance
    *   [`AvoidUsingShortType`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.31.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#avoidusingshorttype): arithmetic on shorts is not significantly
        slower than on ints, whereas using shorts may provide significant memory savings in arrays.
    *   [`SimplifyStartsWith`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.31.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#simplifystartswith): the suggested code transformation has an
        insignificant performance impact, and decreases readability.

### API Changes

#### Deprecated API

*   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-xml/6.31.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/xml/rule/AbstractDomXmlRule.html#"><code>AbstractDomXmlRule</code></a>
*   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-xml/6.31.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/wsdl/rule/AbstractWsdlRule.html#"><code>AbstractWsdlRule</code></a>
*   A few methods of <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-xml/6.31.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/xml/rule/AbstractXmlRule.html#"><code>AbstractXmlRule</code></a>

#### Experimental APIs

*   The method <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.31.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/GenericToken.html#getKind()"><code>GenericToken#getKind</code></a> has been added as experimental. This
    unifies the token interface for both JavaCC and Antlr. The already existing method
    <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.31.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/token/AntlrToken.html#getKind()"><code>AntlrToken#getKind</code></a> is therefore experimental as well. The
    returned constant depends on the actual language and might change whenever the grammar
    of the language is changed.
