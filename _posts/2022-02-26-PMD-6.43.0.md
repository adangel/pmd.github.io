### API Changes

#### Deprecated API

Some API deprecations were performed in core PMD classes, to improve compatibility with PMD 7.
- <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.43.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Report.html#"><code>Report</code></a>: the constructor and other construction methods like addViolation or createReport
- <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.43.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleContext.html#"><code>RuleContext</code></a>: all constructors, getters and setters. A new set
of stable methods, matching those in PMD 7, was added to replace the `addViolation`
overloads of <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.43.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/AbstractRule.html#"><code>AbstractRule</code></a>. In PMD 7, `RuleContext` will
be the API to report violations, and it can already be used as such in PMD 6.
- The field <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.43.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/PMD.html#configuration"><code>configuration</code></a> is unused and will be removed.

#### Internal API

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

- <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.43.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSet.html#"><code>RuleSet</code></a>: methods that serve to apply rules, including `apply`, `start`, `end`, `removeDysfunctionalRules`
- <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.43.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/renderers/AbstractAccumulatingRenderer.html#renderFileReport(Report)"><code>AbstractAccumulatingRenderer#renderFileReport</code></a> is internal API
  and should not be overridden in own renderers.

#### Changed API

It is now forbidden to report a violation:
- With a `null` node
- With a `null` message
- With a `null` set of format arguments (prefer a zero-length array)

Note that the message is set from the XML rule declaration, so this is only relevant
if you instantiate rules manually.

<a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.43.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleContext.html#"><code>RuleContext</code></a> now requires setting the current rule before calling
<a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.43.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Rule.html#apply(java.util.List,net.sourceforge.pmd.RuleContext)"><code>apply</code></a>. This is
done automatically by `RuleSet#apply` and such. Creating and configuring a
`RuleContext` manually is strongly advised against, as the lifecycle of `RuleContext`
will change drastically in PMD 7.
