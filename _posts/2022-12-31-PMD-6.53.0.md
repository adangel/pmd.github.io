### New and noteworthy

#### Modified rules

* The Java rule [`UnusedPrivateField`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.53.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unusedprivatefield) has a new property `reportForAnnotations`.
  This is a list of fully qualified names of the annotation types that should be reported anyway. If an unused field
  has any of these annotations, then it is reported. If it has any other annotation, then it is still considered 
  to be used and is not reported.

#### Deprecated rules

* The Java rules [`ExcessiveClassLength`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.53.0/pmd_rules_java_design.html#excessiveclasslength) and [`ExcessiveMethodLength`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.53.0/pmd_rules_java_design.html#excessivemethodlength)
  have been deprecated. The rule [`NcssCount`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.53.0/pmd_rules_java_design.html#ncsscount) can be used instead.
  The deprecated rules will be removed with PMD 7.0.0.

* The Java rule [`EmptyStatementNotInLoop`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.53.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#emptystatementnotinloop) is deprecated.
  Use the rule [`UnnecessarySemicolon`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.53.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#unnecessarysemicolon) instead.
  Note: Actually it was announced to be deprecated since 6.46.0 but the rule was not marked as deprecated yet.
  This has been done now.
