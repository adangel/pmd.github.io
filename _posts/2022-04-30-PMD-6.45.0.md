### New and noteworthy

#### PMD User Survey

Help shape the future of PMD by telling us how you use it.

Our little survey is still open in case you didn't participate yet.
Please participate in our survey at <https://forms.gle/4d8r1a1RDzfixHDc7>.

Thank you!

#### Support for HTML

This version of PMD ships a new language module to support analyzing of HTML.
Support for HTML is experimental and might change without notice.
The language implementation is not complete yet and the AST doesn't look
well for text nodes and comment nodes and might be changed in the future.
You can write your own rules, but we don't guarantee that the rules work with
the next (minor) version of PMD without adjustments.

Please give us feedback about how practical this new language is in
[discussions](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/discussions). Please report
missing features or bugs as new [issues](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues).

#### New rules

* The HTML rule [`AvoidInlineStyles`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.45.0/pmd_rules_html_bestpractices.html#avoidinlinestyles) finds elements which use a style attribute.
  In order to help maintaining a webpage it is considered good practice to separate content and styles. Instead
  of inline styles one should use CSS files and classes.

```xml
    <rule ref="category/html/bestpractices.xml/AvoidInlineStyles" />
```

* The HTML rule [`UnnecessaryTypeAttribute`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.45.0/pmd_rules_html_bestpractices.html#unnecessarytypeattribute) finds "link" and "script" elements which
  still have a "type" attribute. This is not necessary anymore since modern browsers automatically use CSS and
  JavaScript.

```xml
      <rule ref="category/html/bestpractices.xml/UnnecessaryTypeAttribute" />
```

* The HTML rule [`UseAltAttributeForImages`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.45.0/pmd_rules_html_bestpractices.html#usealtattributeforimages) finds "img" elements without an "alt"
  attribute. An alternate text should always be provided in order to help screen readers.

```xml
      <rule ref="category/html/bestpractices.xml/UseAltAttributeForImages" />
```

#### Modified rules

*   The Java rule [`UnusedPrivateField`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.45.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unusedprivatefield) has a new property `ignoredFieldNames`.
    The default ignores serialization-specific fields (eg `serialVersionUID`).
    The property can be used to ignore more fields based on their name.
    Note that the rule used to ignore fields named `IDENT`, but doesn't anymore (add this value to the property to restore the old behaviour).

### API Changes

#### Experimental APIs

* Report has two new methods which allow limited mutations of a given report:
  * <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.45.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Report.html#filterViolations(net.sourceforge.pmd.util.Predicate)"><code>Report#filterViolations</code></a> creates a new report with
    some violations removed with a given predicate based filter.
  * <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.45.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Report.html#union(net.sourceforge.pmd.Report)"><code>Report#union</code></a> can combine two reports into a single new Report.
* <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.45.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/util/Predicate.html#"><code>net.sourceforge.pmd.util.Predicate</code></a> will be replaced in PMD7 with the standard Predicate interface from java8.
* The module `pmd-html` is entirely experimental right now. Anything in the package
  `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.html` should be used cautiously.
