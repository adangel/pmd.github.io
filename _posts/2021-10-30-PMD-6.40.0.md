### New and noteworthy

#### Updated Apex Support

*   The Apex language support has been bumped to version 54.0 (Spring '22).

#### New rules

*   The new Apex rule [`EagerlyLoadedDescribeSObjectResult`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.40.0/pmd_rules_apex_performance.html#eagerlyloadeddescribesobjectresult) finds
    `DescribeSObjectResult`s which could have been loaded eagerly via `SObjectType.getDescribe()`.

```xml
    <rule ref="category/apex/performance.xml/EagerlyLoadedDescribeSObjectResult" />
```

#### Modified rules

*   The Apex rule [`ApexUnitTestClassShouldHaveAsserts`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.40.0/pmd_rules_apex_bestpractices.html#apexunittestclassshouldhaveasserts) has a new property
    `additionalAssertMethodPattern`. When specified the pattern is evaluated against each invoked
    method name to determine whether it represents a test assertion in addition to the standard names.

*   The Apex rule [`ApexDoc`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.40.0/pmd_rules_apex_documentation.html#apexdoc) has a new property `reportMissingDescription`.
    If set to `false` (default is `true` if unspecified) doesn't report an issue if the `@description`
    tag is missing. This is consistent with the ApexDoc dialect supported by derivatives such as
    [SfApexDoc](https://gitlab.com/StevenWCox/sfapexdoc) and also with analogous documentation tools for
    other languages, e.g., JavaDoc, ESDoc/JSDoc, etc.

*   The Apex rule [`ApexCRUDViolation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.40.0/pmd_rules_apex_security.html#apexcrudviolation) has a couple of new properties:
    These allow specification of regular-expression-based patterns for additional methods that should
    be considered valid for pre-CRUD authorization beyond those offered by the system Apex checks and
    ESAPI, e.g., [`sirono-common`'s `AuthorizationUtil` class](https://github.com/SCWells72/sirono-common#authorization-utilities).
    Two new properties have been added per-CRUD operation, one to specify the naming pattern for a method
    that authorizes that operation and another to specify the argument passed to that method that contains
    the `SObjectType` instance of the type being authorized. Here is an example of these new properties:
    
    ```xml
    <rule ref="category/apex/security.xml/ApexCRUDViolation" message="...">
      <priority>3</priority>
      <properties>
        <property name="createAuthMethodPattern" value="AuthorizationUtil\.(is|assert)(Createable|Upsertable)"/>
        <!--
         There's one of these properties for each operation, and the default value is 0 so this is technically
         superfluous, but it's included it here for example purposes.
         -->
        <property name="createAuthMethodTypeParamIndex" value="0"/>
        <property name="readAuthMethodPattern" value="AuthorizationUtil\.(is|assert)Accessible"/>
        <property name="updateAuthMethodPattern" value="AuthorizationUtil\.(is|assert)(Updateable|Upsertable)"/>
        <property name="deleteAuthMethodPattern" value="AuthorizationUtil\.(is|assert)Deletable"/>
        <property name="undeleteAuthMethodPattern" value="AuthorizationUtil\.(is|assert)Undeletable"/>
        <property name="mergeAuthMethodPattern" value="AuthorizationUtil\.(is|assert)Mergeable"/>
      </properties>
    </rule>
    ```

*   The Apex rule [`EmptyStatementBlock`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.40.0/pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#emptystatementblock) has two new properties:
    
    Setting `reportEmptyPrivateNoArgConstructor` to `false` ignores empty private no-arg constructors
    that are commonly used in singleton pattern implementations and utility classes in support of
    prescribed best practices.
    
    Setting `reportEmptyVirtualMethod` to `false` ignores empty virtual methods that are commonly used in
    abstract base classes as default no-op implementations when derived classes typically only override a
    subset of virtual methods.
    
    By default, both properties are `true` to not change the default behaviour of this rule.

*   The Apex rule [`EmptyCatchBlock`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.40.0/pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#emptycatchblock) has two new properties modeled after the analgous Java rule:
    
    The `allowCommentedBlocks` property, when set to `true` (defaults to `false`), ignores empty blocks containing comments, e.g.:

    ```apex
    try {
        doSomethingThatThrowsAnExpectedException();
        System.assert(false, 'Expected to catch an exception.');
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Expected
    }
    ```

    The `allowExceptionNameRegex` property is a regular expression for exception variable names for which empty catch blocks should be ignored by this rule. For example, using the default property value of `^(ignored|expected)$`, the following empty catch blocks will not be reported:

    ```apex
    try {
        doSomethingThatThrowsAnExpectedException();
        System.assert(false, 'Expected to catch an exception.');
    } catch (IllegalStateException ignored) {
    } catch (NumberFormatException expected) {
    }
    ```

*   The Apex rule [`OneDeclarationPerLine`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.40.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#onedeclarationperline) has a new property `reportInForLoopInitializer`:
    If set to `false` (default is `true` if unspecified) doesn't report an issue for multiple declarations in
    a `for` loop's initializer section. This is support the common idiom of one declaration for the loop variable
    and another for the loop bounds condition, e.g.,
    
    ```apex
    for (Integer i = 0, numIterations = computeNumIterations(); i < numIterations; i++) {
    }
    ```

*   The Java rule [`ClassNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.40.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#classnamingconventions) uses a different default value of the
    property `utilityClassPattern`: This rule was detecting utility classes by default since PMD 6.3.0
    and enforcing the naming convention that utility classes has to be suffixed with Util or Helper or Constants.
    However this turned out to be not so useful as a default configuration, as there is no standard
    naming convention for utility classes.
    
    With PMD 6.40.0, the default value of this property has been changed to `[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*`
    (Pascal case), effectively disabling the special handling of utility classes. This is the same default
    pattern used for concrete classes.
    
    This means, that the feature to enforce a naming convention for utility classes is now a opt-in
    feature and can be enabled on demand.
    
    To use the old behaviour, the property needs to be configured as follows:
    
    ```xml
    <rule ref="category/java/codestyle.xml/ClassNamingConventions">
        <properties>
            <property name="utilityClassPattern" value="[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+(Utils?|Helper|Constants)" />
        </properties>
    </rule>
    ```

### API Changes

#### Experimental APIs

*   The interface <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-apex/6.40.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/apex/ast/ASTCommentContainer.html#"><code>ASTCommentContainer</code></a> has been added to the Apex AST.
    It provides a way to check whether a node contains at least one comment. Currently this is only implemented for
    <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-apex/6.40.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/apex/ast/ASTCatchBlockStatement.html#"><code>ASTCatchBlockStatement</code></a> and used by the rule
    [`EmptyCatchBlock`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.40.0/pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#emptycatchblock).
    This information is also available via XPath attribute `@ContainsComment`.
