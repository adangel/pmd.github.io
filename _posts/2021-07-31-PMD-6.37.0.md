### New and noteworthy

#### Java 17 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 17. PMD supports [JEP 409: Sealed Classes](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/409)
which has been promoted to be a standard language feature of Java 17.

PMD also supports [JEP 406: Pattern Matching for switch (Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/406) as a preview
language feature. In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these language features, you'll need to enable
it via the environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` and select the new language version `17-preview`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    ./run.sh pmd -language java -version 17-preview ...

Note: Support for Java 15 preview language features have been removed. The version "15-preview" is no longer available.

#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/6.37.0).

#### New rules

This release ships with 3 new Java rules.

*   [`PrimitiveWrapperInstantiation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#primitivewrapperinstantiation) reports usages of primitive wrapper
    constructors. They are deprecated since Java 9 and should not be used.

```xml
    <rule ref="category/java/bestpractices.xml/PrimitiveWrapperInstantiation" />
```

   The rule is part of the quickstart.xml ruleset.

*   [`SimplifiableTestAssertion`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#simplifiabletestassertion) suggests rewriting
    some test assertions to be more readable.

```xml
    <rule ref="category/java/bestpractices.xml/SimplifiableTestAssertion" />
```

   The rule is part of the quickstart.xml ruleset.

*   [`ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#returnemptycollectionratherthannull) suggests returning empty collections / arrays
    instead of null.

```xml
    <rule ref="category/java/errorprone.xml/ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull" />
```

   The rule is part of the quickstart.xml ruleset.

#### Renamed rules

*   The Java rule [`MissingBreakInSwitch`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#missingbreakinswitch) has been renamed to
    [`ImplicitSwitchFallThrough`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#implicitswitchfallthrough) (category error prone) to better reflect the rule's
    purpose: The rule finds implicit fall-through cases in switch statements, which are most
    likely unexpected. The old rule name described only one way how to avoid a fall-through,
    namely using `break` but `continue`, `throw` and `return` avoid a fall-through
    as well. This enables us to improve this rule in the future.

#### Deprecated rules

*   The following Java rules are deprecated and removed from the quickstart ruleset,
    as the new rule [`SimplifiableTestAssertion`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#simplifiabletestassertion) merges
    their functionality:
    * [`UseAssertEqualsInsteadOfAssertTrue`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#useassertequalsinsteadofasserttrue)
    * [`UseAssertNullInsteadOfAssertTrue`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#useassertnullinsteadofasserttrue)
    * [`UseAssertSameInsteadOfAssertTrue`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#useassertsameinsteadofasserttrue)
    * [`UseAssertTrueInsteadOfAssertEquals`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#useasserttrueinsteadofassertequals)
    * [`SimplifyBooleanAssertion`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_design.html#simplifybooleanassertion)

*   The Java rule [`ReturnEmptyArrayRatherThanNull`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#returnemptyarrayratherthannull) is deprecated and removed from
    the quickstart ruleset, as the new rule [`ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#returnemptycollectionratherthannull)
    supersedes it.

*   The following Java rules are deprecated and removed from the quickstart ruleset,
    as the new rule [`PrimitiveWrapperInstantiation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#primitivewrapperinstantiation) merges
    their functionality:
    * [`BooleanInstantiation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#booleaninstantiation)
    * [`ByteInstantiation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#byteinstantiation)
    * [`IntegerInstantiation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#integerinstantiation)
    * [`LongInstantiation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#longinstantiation)
    * [`ShortInstantiation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#shortinstantiation)

*   The Java rule [`UnnecessaryWrapperObjectCreation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.37.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#unnecessarywrapperobjectcreation) is deprecated
    with no planned replacement before PMD 7. In it's current state, the rule is not useful
    as it finds only contrived cases of creating a primitive wrapper and unboxing it explicitly
    in the same expression. In PMD 7 this and more cases will be covered by a
    new rule `UnnecessaryBoxing`.

### API Changes

#### PMD CLI

*   PMD has a new CLI option `-force-language`. With that a language can be forced to be used for all input files,
    irrespective of filenames. When using this option, the automatic language selection by extension is disabled
    and all files are tried to be parsed with the given language. Parsing errors are ignored and unparsable files
    are skipped.
    
    This option allows to use the xml language for files, that don't use xml as extension.
    See also the examples on [PMD CLI reference](pmd_userdocs_cli_reference.html#analyze-other-xml-formats).

#### Experimental APIs

*   The AST types and APIs around Sealed Classes are not experimental anymore:
    *   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-java/6.37.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration.html#isSealed()"><code>ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration#isSealed</code></a>,
        <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-java/6.37.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration.html#isNonSealed()"><code>ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration#isNonSealed</code></a>,
        <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-java/6.37.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration.html#getPermittedSubclasses()"><code>ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration#getPermittedSubclasses</code></a>
    *   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-java/6.37.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTPermitsList.html#"><code>ASTPermitsList</code></a>

#### Internal API

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

*   The inner class <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.37.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/TokenEntry.State.html#"><code>net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.TokenEntry.State</code></a> is considered to be internal API.
    It will probably be moved away with PMD 7.
