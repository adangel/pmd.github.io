### New and noteworthy

#### Lua now supports additionally Luau

This release of PMD adds support for [Luau](https://github.com/Roblox/luau), a gradually typed language derived
from Lua. This means, that the Lua language in PMD can now parse both Lua and Luau.

#### Modified rules

* The Java rule [`UnusedPrivateField`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.50.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unusedprivatefield) now ignores private fields, if the fields are
 annotated with any annotation or the enclosing class has any annotation. Annotations often enable a
 framework (such as dependency injection, mocking or e.g. Lombok) which use the fields by reflection or other
 means. This usage can't be detected by static code analysis. Previously these frameworks where explicitly allowed
 by listing their annotations in the property "ignoredAnnotations", but that turned out to be prone of false
 positive for any not explicitly considered framework. That's why the property "ignoredAnnotations" has been
 deprecated for this rule.
* The Java rule [`CommentDefaultAccessModifier`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.50.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#commentdefaultaccessmodifier) now by default ignores JUnit5 annotated
 methods. This behavior can be customized using the property `ignoredAnnotations`.
