### üöÄ New and noteworthy

#### üöÄ New: Java 24 Support
This release of PMD brings support for Java 24. There are no new standard language features,
but a couple of preview language features:

* [JEP 488: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/488)
* [JEP 492: Flexible Constructor Bodies (Third Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/492)
* [JEP 494: Module Import Declarations (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/494)
* [JEP 495: Simple Source Files and Instance Main Methods (Fourth Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/495)

In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these preview language features,
you'll need to enable it via the environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` and select the new language
version `24-preview`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    pmd check --use-version java-24-preview ...

Note: Support for Java 22 preview language features have been removed. The version "22-preview"
is no longer available.

#### New GPG Release Signing Key

Since January 2025, we switched the GPG Key we use for signing releases in Maven Central to be
[A0B5CA1A4E086838](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x2EFA55D0785C31F956F2F87EA0B5CA1A4E086838&fingerprint=on&op=index).
The full fingerprint is `2EFA 55D0 785C 31F9 56F2  F87E A0B5 CA1A 4E08 6838`.

This step was necessary, as the passphrase of the old key has been compromised and therefore the key is not
safe to use anymore. While the key itself is not compromised as far as we know, we still decided to generate a
new key, just to be safe. As until now (January 2025) we are not aware, that the key actually has been misused.
The previous releases of PMD in Maven Central can still be considered untampered, as Maven Central is read-only.

This unexpected issue was discovered while checking [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) by a
third party.

The security advisory about the compromised passphrase is tracked as
[GHSA-88m4-h43f-wx84](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/security/advisories/GHSA-88m4-h43f-wx84)
and [CVE-2025-23215](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23215).

#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog (7.10.0)](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/7.10.0).

### üåü New and changed rules

#### New Rules

* The new Java rule [`ExhaustiveSwitchHasDefault`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.10.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#exhaustiveswitchhasdefault) finds switch statements and
  expressions, that cover already all cases but still have a default case. This default case is unnecessary
  and prevents getting compiler errors when e.g. new enum constants are added without extending the switch.

### üêõ Fixed Issues
* apex
  * [#5388](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/5388): \[apex] Parse error with time literal in SOQL query
  * [#5456](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/5456): \[apex] Issue with java dependency apex-parser-4.3.1 but apex-parser-4.3.0 works
* apex-security
  * [#3158](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3158): \[apex] ApexSuggestUsingNamedCred false positive with Named Credential merge fields
* documentation
  * [#2492](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2492): \[doc] Promote wiki pages to standard doc pages
* java
  * [#5154](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/5154): \[java] Support Java 24
* java-performance
  * [#5311](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/5311): \[java] TooFewBranchesForSwitch false positive for exhaustive switches over enums without default case

### üö® API Changes

#### Removed Experimental API
* pmd-java
  * `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.ast.ASTTemplate`, `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.ast.ASTTemplateExpression`,
    `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.ast.ASTTemplateFragment`: These nodes were introduced with Java 21 and 22
    Preview to support String Templates. However, the String Template preview feature was not finalized
    and has been removed from Java for now. We now cleaned up the PMD implementation of it.
