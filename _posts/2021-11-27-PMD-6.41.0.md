### New and noteworthy

#### GitHub Action for PMD

PMD now has its own official GitHub Action: [GitHub Action for PMD](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pmd).
It can execute PMD with your own ruleset against your project. It creates a [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html)
report which is uploaded as a build artifact. Furthermore the build can be failed based on the number of violations.

Feedback and pull requests are welcome at <https://github.com/pmd/pmd-github-action>.

#### Last release in 2021

This minor release will be the last one in 2021. The next release is scheduled to be end of January 2022.

### API Changes

#### Command Line Interface

The command line options for PMD and CPD now use GNU-syle long options format. E.g. instead of `-rulesets` the
preferred usage is now `--rulesets`. Alternatively one can still use the short option `-R`.
Some options also have been renamed to a more consistent casing pattern at the same time
(`--fail-on-violation` instead of `-failOnViolation`).
The old single-dash options are still supported but are deprecated and will be removed with PMD 7.
This change makes the command line interface more consistent within PMD and also less surprising
compared to other cli tools.
