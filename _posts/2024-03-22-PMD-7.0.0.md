### Changes since 7.0.0-rc4

This section lists the most important changes from the last release candidate.
The remaining section describes the complete release notes for 7.0.0.

#### New and Noteworthy

##### Maven PMD Plugin compatibility with PMD 7

In order to use PMD 7 with [maven-pmd-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/) a new
compatibility module has been created. This allows to use PMD 7 by simply adding one additional dependency:

1. Follow the guide [Upgrading PMD at Runtime](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/examples/upgrading-PMD-at-runtime.html)
2. Add additionally the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.sourceforge.pmd</groupId>
  <artifactId>pmd-compat6</artifactId>
  <version>${pmdVersion}</version>
</dependency>
```

It is important to add this dependency as the **first** in the list, so that maven-pmd-plugin sees the (old)
compatible versions of some classes.

This module is available beginning with version 7.0.0-rc4 and will be there at least for the first
final version PMD 7 (7.0.0). It's not decided yet, whether we will keep updating it, after PMD 7 is finally
released.

Note: This compatibility module only works for the built-in rules, that are still available in PMD 7. E.g. you need
to review your rulesets and look out for deprecated rules and such. See the use case
[I'm using only built-in rules](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_userdocs_migrating_to_pmd7.html#im-using-only-built-in-rules)
in the [Migration Guide for PMD 7](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_userdocs_migrating_to_pmd7.html).

As PMD 7 revamped the Java module, if you have custom rules, you need to migrate these rules.
See the use case [I'm using custom rules](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_userdocs_migrating_to_pmd7.html#im-using-custom-rules)
in the Migration Guide.

Note: Once the default version of PMD is upgraded to PMD7 in maven-pmd-plugin
(see [MPMD-379](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MPMD/issues/MPMD-379)), this
compatibility module is no longer needed. The module pmd-compat6 might not be maintained then
any further, hence it is already declared as deprecated.

No guarantee is given, that the (deprecated) module pmd-compat6 is being maintained over the
whole lifetime of PMD 7.

##### Java 22 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 22. There are the following new standard language features,
that are supported now:

* [JEP 456: Unnamed Variables & Patterns](https://openjdk.org/jeps/456)

PMD also supports the following preview language features:

* [JEP 447: Statements before super(...) (Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/447)
* [JEP 459: String Templates (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/459)
* [JEP 463: Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/463)

In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these language features,
you'll need to enable it via the environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` and select the new language
version `22-preview`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    pmd check --use-version java-22-preview ...

Note: Support for Java 20 preview language features have been removed. The version "20-preview" is no longer available.

##### Swift Support

* limited support for Swift 5.9 (Macro Expansions)

##### Groovy Support (CPD)

* We now support parsing all Groovy features from Groovy 3 and 4.
* We now support [suppression](pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#suppression) through `CPD-ON`/`CPD-OFF` comment pairs.
* See [PR #4726](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4726) for details.

##### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer. The designer artifact has been
renamed from "pmd-ui" to "pmd-designer". While the designer still works with Java 8, the
recommended Java Runtime is Java 11 (or later) with OpenJFX 17 (or later).

For the detailed changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog (7.0.0)](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/7.0.0).

##### Apex Support: Replaced Jorje with fully open source front-end

When PMD added Apex support with version 5.5.0, it utilized the Apex Jorje library to parse Apex source
and generate an AST. This library is however a binary-blob provided as part of the
[Salesforce Extensions for VS Code](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode), and it is closed-source.

This causes problems, if binary blobs are not allowed by e.g. a company-wide policy. In that case, the Jorje
library prevented that PMD Apex could be used at all.

Also having access to the source code, enhancements and modifications are easier to do.

Under the hood, we use two open source libraries instead:

* [apex-parser](https://github.com/apex-dev-tools/apex-parser) originally by
  [Kevin Jones](https://github.com/nawforce) (@nawforce).
  This project provides the grammar for a ANTLR based parser.
* [Summit-AST](https://github.com/google/summit-ast) by [Google](https://github.com/google) (@google)
  This project translates the ANTLR parse tree into an AST, that is similar to the AST Jorje provided.
  Note: This is not an official Google product.

Although the parser is completely switched, there are only little known changes to the AST.
These are documented in the [Migration Guide for PMD 7: Apex AST](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_userdocs_migrating_to_pmd7.html#apex-ast).

With the new Apex parser, the new language constructs like
[User Mode Database Operations](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_enforce_usermode.htm)
and the new [Null Coalescing Operator `??`](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/langCon_apex_NullCoalescingOperator.htm)
can be parsed now. PMD should be able to parse Apex code up to version 60.0 (Spring '24).

See [#3766](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3766) for details.

##### Changed: Visualforce

There was an inconsistency between the naming of the maven module and the language id. The language id
used the abbreviation "vf", while the maven module used the longer name "visualforce". This has been
solved by renaming the language module to its full name "visualforce". The java packages have
been renamed as well.

If you import rules, you also need to adjust the paths, e.g.

* `category/vf/security.xml` ‚û°Ô∏è `category/visualforce/security.xml`

##### Changed: HTML support

Support for HTML was introduced in PMD 6.55.0 as an experimental feature. With PMD 7.0.0 this
is now considered stable.

##### Changed: Kotlin support

Support for Kotlin was introduced with PMD 7.0.0-rc1 as an experimental feature. With PMD 7.0.0 this
is now considered stable.

##### Changed: Velocity Template Language (VTL)

The module was named just "vm" which was not a good name. Its module name, language id and
package names have been renamed to "velocity".

If you import rules, you also need to adjust the paths, e.g.

* `category/vm/...` ‚û°Ô∏è `category/velocity/...`

#### Rule Changes

**New Rules**

* [`OperationWithHighCostInLoop`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_apex_performance.html#operationwithhighcostinloop) finds Schema class methods called in a loop, which is a
  potential performance issue.
* [`UseExplicitTypes`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#useexplicittypes) reports usages of `var` keyword, which was introduced with Java 10.
* [`MissingEncoding`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_xml_bestpractices.html#missingencoding) finds XML files without explicit encoding.

**Changed Rules**

* [`EmptyControlStatement`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#emptycontrolstatement): The rule has a new property to allow empty blocks when
  they contain a comment (`allowCommentedBlocks`).
* [`MethodNamingConventions`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#methodnamingconventions): The deprecated rule property `skipTestMethodUnderscores` has
  been removed. It was actually deprecated since PMD 6.15.0, but was not mentioned in the release notes
  back then. Use the property `testPattern` instead to configure valid names for test methods.
* [`CommentRequired`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_java_documentation.html#commentrequired): The deprecated property `headerCommentRequirement` has been removed.
  Use the property `classCommentRequirement` instead.
* [`NonSerializableClass`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#nonserializableclass): The deprecated property `prefix` has been removed
  without replacement. In a serializable class all fields have to be serializable regardless of the name.

**Renamed Rulesets**

* `category/vf/security.xml` ‚û°Ô∏è `category/visualforce/security.xml`
* `category/vm/bestpractices.xml` ‚û°Ô∏è `category/velocity/bestpractices.xml`
* `category/vm/design.xml` ‚û°Ô∏è `category/velocity/design.xml`
* `category/vm/errorprone.xml` ‚û°Ô∏è `category/velocity/errorprone.xml`

**Removed Rules**

### üéâ Language Related Changes

Note that this is just a concise listing of the highlights.
For more information on the languages, see the [Detailed Release Notes for PMD 7](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_release_notes_pmd7.html#-language-related-changes).

#### New: CPD support for Apache Velocity Template Language (VTL)

PMD supported Apache Velocity for a very long time, but the CPD integration never got finished.
This is now done and CPD supports Apache Velocity Template language for detecting copy and paste.
It is shipped in the module `pmd-velocity`.

#### New: CPD support for Coco

Thanks to a contribution, CPD now supports Coco, a modern programming language
designed specifically for building event-driven software. It is shipped in the new
module `pmd-coco`.

Contributors: [Wener](https://github.com/wener-tiobe) (@wener-tiobe)

#### New: CPD support for Julia

Thanks to a contribution, CPD now supports the Julia language. It is shipped
in the new module `pmd-julia`.

Contributors: [Wener](https://github.com/wener-tiobe) (@wener-tiobe)

#### New: CPD support for TypeScript

Thanks to a contribution, CPD now supports the TypeScript language. It is shipped
with the rest of the JavaScript support in the module `pmd-javascript`.

Contributors: [Paul Guyot](https://github.com/pguyot) (@pguyot)

#### New: Java 21 and 22 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 21 and 22. There are the following new standard language features,
that are supported now:

* [JEP 456: Unnamed Variables & Patterns](https://openjdk.org/jeps/456) (Java 22)
* [JEP 440: Record Patterns](https://openjdk.org/jeps/440) (Java 21)
* [JEP 441: Pattern Matching for switch](https://openjdk.org/jeps/441) (Java 21)

PMD also supports the following preview language features:

* [JEP 447: Statements before super(...) (Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/447) (Java 22)
* [JEP 459: String Templates (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/459) (Java 21 and 22)
* [JEP 463: Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/463) (Java 21 and 22)

In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these preview language features,
you'll need to enable it via the environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` and select the new language
version `22-preview`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    pmd check --use-version java-22-preview ...

Note: Support for Java 19 and Java 20 preview language features have been removed. The versions "19-preview" and
"20-preview" are no longer available.

#### New: Kotlin support

* Use PMD to analyze Kotlin code with PMD rules.
* Support for Kotlin 1.8 grammar
* Initially 2 built-in rules
* Support for Kotlin was introduced with PMD 7.0.0-rc1 as an experimental feature. With PMD 7.0.0 this
  is now considered stable.

[Peter Paul Bakker](https://github.com/stokpop) (@stokpop)

#### New: Swift support

* Use PMD to analyze Swift code with PMD rules.
* Limited support for Swift 5.9 (Macro Expansions)
* Initially 4 built-in rules

[Tom√°s De Lucca](https://github.com/tomidelucca) (@tomidelucca)

#### Changed: Apex Support: Replaced Jorje with fully open source front-end

When PMD added Apex support with version 5.5.0, it utilized the Apex Jorje library to parse Apex source
and generate an AST. This library is however a binary-blob provided as part of the
[Salesforce Extensions for VS Code](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode), and it is closed-source.

This causes problems, if binary blobs are not allowed by e.g. a company-wide policy. In that case, the Jorje
library prevented that PMD Apex could be used at all.

Also having access to the source code, enhancements and modifications are easier to do.

Under the hood, we use two open source libraries instead:

* [apex-parser](https://github.com/nawforce/apex-parser) by [Kevin Jones](https://github.com/nawforce) (@nawforce)
  This project provides the grammar for a ANTLR based parser.
* [Summit-AST](https://github.com/google/summit-ast) by [Google](https://github.com/google) (@google)
  This project translates the ANTLR parse tree into an AST, that is similar to the AST Jorje provided.
  Note: This is not an official Google product.

Although the parsers is completely switched, there are only little known changes to the AST.
These are documented in the [Migration Guide for PMD 7: Apex AST](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_userdocs_migrating_to_pmd7.html#apex-ast).
With the new Apex parser, the new language constructs like
[User Mode Database Operations](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_enforce_usermode.htm)
and the new [Null Coalescing Operator `??`](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/langCon_apex_NullCoalescingOperator.htm)
can be parsed now. PMD should be able to parse Apex code up to version 60.0 (Spring '24).

See [#3766](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3766) for details.

#### Changed: CPP can now ignore identifiers in sequences (CPD)

* New command line option for CPD: `--ignore-sequences`.
* This option is used for CPP only: with the already existing option `--ignore-literal-sequences`, only
  literals were ignored. The new option additionally ignores identifiers as well in sequences.
* See [PR #4470](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4470) for details.

Contributors: [Wener](https://github.com/wener-tiobe) (@wener-tiobe)

#### Changed: Groovy Support (CPD)

* We now support parsing all Groovy features from Groovy 3 and 4.
* We now support [suppression](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#suppression) through `CPD-ON`/`CPD-OFF` comment pairs.
* See [PR #4726](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4726) for details.

Contributors: [Juan Mart√≠n Sotuyo Dodero](https://github.com/jsotuyod) (@jsotuyod)

#### Changed: HTML support

Support for HTML was introduced in PMD 6.55.0 as an experimental feature. With PMD 7.0.0 this
is now considered stable.

#### Changed: JavaScript support

* Latest version supports ES6 and also some new constructs (see [Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino))
* Comments are retained

#### Changed: Language versions

* More predefined language versions for each supported language
* Can be used to limit rule execution for specific versions only with `minimumLanguageVersion` and
  `maximumLanguageVersion` attributes.

#### Changed: Rule properties

* The old deprecated classes like `IntProperty` and `StringProperty` have been removed. Please use
  <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/7.0.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#"><code>PropertyFactory</code></a> to create properties.
* All properties which accept multiple values now use a comma (`,`) as a delimiter. The previous default was a
  pipe character (`|`). The delimiter is not configurable anymore. If needed, the comma can be escaped
  with a backslash.
* The `min` and `max` attributes in property definitions in the XML are now optional and can appear separately
  or be omitted.

#### Changed: Velocity Template Language (VTL)

The module was named just "vm" which was not a good name. Its module name, language id and
package names have been renamed to "velocity".

If you import rules, you also need to adjust the paths, e.g.

* `category/vm/...` ‚û°Ô∏è `category/velocity/...`

#### Changed: Visualforce

There was an inconsistency between the naming of the maven module and the language id. The language id
used the abbreviation "vf", while the maven module used the longer name "visualforce". This has been
solved by renaming the language module to its full name "visualforce". The java packages have
been renamed as well.

If you import rules, you also need to adjust the paths, e.g.

* `category/vf/security.xml` ‚û°Ô∏è `category/visualforce/security.xml`

### üåü New and changed rules

#### New Rules

**Apex**
* [`OperationWithHighCostInLoop`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_apex_performance.html#operationwithhighcostinloop) finds Schema class methods called in a loop, which is a
  potential performance issue.
* [`UnusedMethod`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_apex_design.html#unusedmethod) finds unused methods in your code.

**Java**
* [`UnnecessaryBoxing`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#unnecessaryboxing) reports boxing and unboxing conversions that may be made implicit.
* [`UseExplicitTypes`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#useexplicittypes) reports usages of `var` keyword, which was introduced with Java 10.

**Kotlin**
* [`FunctionNameTooShort`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_kotlin_bestpractices.html#functionnametooshort) finds functions with a too short name.
* [`OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_kotlin_errorprone.html#overridebothequalsandhashcode) finds classes with only
  either `equals` or `hashCode` overridden, but not both. This leads to unexpected behavior once instances
  of such classes are used in collections (Lists, HashMaps, ...).

**Swift**
* [`ForceCast`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_swift_errorprone.html#forcecast) flags all force casts, making sure you are
  defensively considering all types. Having the application crash shouldn't be an option.
* [`ForceTry`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_swift_errorprone.html#forcetry) flags all force tries, making sure you are
  defensively handling exceptions. Having the application crash shouldn't be an option.
* [`ProhibitedInterfaceBuilder`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_swift_bestpractices.html#prohibitedinterfacebuilder) flags any usage of interface
  builder. Interface builder files are prone to merge conflicts, and are impossible to code review, so larger
  teams usually try to avoid it or reduce its usage.
* [`UnavailableFunction`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_swift_bestpractices.html#unavailablefunction) flags any function throwing
  a `fatalError` not marked as `@available(*, unavailable)` to ensure no calls are actually performed in
  the codebase.

**XML**
* [`MissingEncoding`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_rules_xml_bestpractices.html#missingencoding) finds XML files without explicit encoding.

#### Other changes

The information about changed rules, removed rules and rulesets
can be found in the [Detailed Release Notes for PMD 7](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_release_notes_pmd7.html#-new-and-changed-rules).

### üö® API

The API of PMD has been growing over the years and needed some cleanup. The goal is, to
have a clear separation between a well-defined API and the implementation, which is internal.
This should help us in future development.

Also, there are some improvement and changes in different areas. For the detailed description
of the changes listed here, see [Detailed Release Notes for PMD 7](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_release_notes_pmd7.html#-api).

* Miscellaneous smaller changes and cleanups
* XPath 3.1 support for XPath-based rules
* Node stream API for AST traversal
* Metrics framework
* Testing framework
* Language Lifecycle and Language Properties
* Rule Properties
* New Programmatic API for CPD
